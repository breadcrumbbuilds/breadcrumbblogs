<p>Starting a Startup is chock-full of feelings that are foreign to your average public school small-town kid. The uncertainty is unsettling, the explicit acknowledgment of hierarchal structure makes even the most iron of stomachs warble, and you have to have determination in pursuit of a goal. That means you have to have the skills to formulate goals, develop a plan to achieve the goal, and then follow through on the plan all the while adjusting to new insights and changing landscapes. In a word, you need to learn to be <em>adaptable</em>.</p>

<p>Partners can become disinterested, so you need some notion of cultivating interest, which means you need to have good insight into other people and what makes them tick. In a word, you need to have dexterous skills in <em>empathy</em>.</p>

<p>How do you know where to go when there’s no road? How do you know how to lead your comrades down a dark and untravelled path? How do you forge a path if there isn’t one? These questions swirl in my mind while I should be thinking of my business.</p>
