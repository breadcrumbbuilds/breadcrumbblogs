My name is Brad, I go by breadcrumbbuilds online. Some years ago I decided to venture into Computer Science and was lucky enough to unearth a feverish passion. Since then I've discovered the beauty of Entrepreneurship, Computing, Machine Learning, Automation, good philosophical books, investing and finance in general, and creative writing. I hope to entertain you with my writings on these subjects and more.
