title: Autonomy and Authenticity
---

There seems to be a correlation between happiness and autonomy. Folks enjoying a lot of autonomy seem to spend their time enthralled by things they love, which explains some of the success of my favourite content creators. Lex Fridman is a great podcast host precisely because he asks the questions he __wants__ to ask. He exercises his autonomy when choosing the direction of a conversation. He exercises his autonomy by speaking to guests he chooses and by wearing the same damn black suit every episode.

I think autonomy enables authenticity. Authenticity has the power to generate autonomy as well.
