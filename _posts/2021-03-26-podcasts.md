Part of the difficulty with breaking into Computer Science is the limited access to relatable content. You can watch endless tutorials, but these fail to deliver some over-arching, human type feeling of what it means to produce systems that change the world. Some blogs are too technical for a newcomer. So I decided to create a collection of resources that have been intellectually accessbile for a newbie, while stimulating enough to feed that never-ending sense of wonder.

## Podcasts
Lex seems to me a gentle soul with a touch of chaos. Through the progress of his podcast, his listeners watch him grow, not just as a technologist, but a person. A real, human-like (debateable), person, that breaths, laughs, dreams, and ponders his own demise - if perhaps too often. Every episode is a treat, but here's a few of my favourites:

### Lex Fridman

[70: Jim Keller](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nb2tebYAaOA)
Without doubt, my favourite podcast episode of all time. Jim Keller feels like a father-figure and the more times I listen to this podcast the more I appreciate the field of Computer Science, especially the hardware we take for granted.

[101: Joscha Bach](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-2P3MSZrBM)
I've listened to this podcast 4 times and plan on a querterly listen for the foreseeable future. Joscha is a marvelous thinker with that rare ability of articulating his thoughts succinctly. For the programmer that leans philosophical, there isn't a better podcast episode.

[74: Michael I. Jordan](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYIKy_FM9x0)
Another podcast on repeat, the 'Miles Davis of Machine Learning' gives a snapshot of how an insider thinks about the field of 'Artificial Intelligenc'. Michael is able to strip away the hype and paint the picture of Machine Learning while retaining all of the excitement on the subject.


### Behind the Tech w/ Kevin Scott
