# Starting A Business

Starting a Startup is chock-full of feelings foreign to your average public school small-town kid. The uncertainty makes your skin crawl, the explicit acknowledgment of hierarchal structure makes even the most iron of stomachs warble, and you have to have determination in pursuit of a goal. That means you have to have the skills to formulate goals, develop a plan to achieve the goal, and then follow through on the plan all the while adjusting to new insights and changing landscapes. In a word, you need to learn to be _adaptable_.

Partners get disinterested, so you need some notion of cultivating interest, which means you need to have good insight into other people and what makes them tick. In a word, you need to have dexterous skills in _empathy_.

There's myriad skills to acquire, but none of them mean a damn unless you _start_. Starting, committing to building the business, is the single largest hurdle.

How do you know where to go when there's no road? How do you know how to lead your comrades down a dark and untravelled path? How do you forge a path if there isn't one? These questions swirl in my mind while I should be thinking of my business.
