In the fall of 2017 while studying Computer Science at Thompson Rivers University, I encountered Machine Learning for the first time. I can't recall if I had heard of the subject before then, but there is little else I've thought of since.

Machine Learning is the subject responsible for things like the Netflix recomendation system, or Amazon's 'things you may also like'. Recently, Machine Learning has been the object of dissonence due to its applications on social media websites. In short, Machine Learning 'learns' to keep you hooked to some content.

This type of application wasn't what piqued my interest.

That fall I had applied to TRU's Coop program and was accepted. The courses I was taking: Mobile Application Development, Data Structures and Algorithms, Database Systems, Linear Algebra, Software Architecture and Design, and Experential Learning (Coop). That fall is a distant memory now, but those courses and enrolling in Coop changed the course of my future. So did my past.

Before I came to school I worked in Sawmills. In the beginning, I worked in mills to fund my aspirations in hockey, but the mill became a habit, I forgot about aspirations, and started a slow spiral. I eventually found myself in a Quality Control role which brought me responsibility and challenge, something I was missing greatly at the time. Unfortunately, I didn't rise to the occassion. Every day, I showed up to punch a clock, wiping down scanners, responding to calls on the radio, with no verve or excitement.

When I think back on those days I hear a lot of voices in my head - loved ones telling me 'you're overthinking it'. It could be anything. The verthinking part, well, now I know what that was.

I was attempting to recognize patterns, my subject of interest was always other people. I was able to notice incongruencies in behaviour but lacked confidence in these observations so I leaned on loved ones for affirmation. The affirmation never came which caused a fair amount of pain for me. Though, I'm fortunate to have discovered many times I was 'overthinking', recognizing patterns that weren't present, and since those days fighting that urge in my own mind has been the most constant, difficult battle. I'm fortunate enough to have a patient, thoughtful partner whose able to guide me in some of my far out moments. Technically, I found a partner that gives me _thoughtful_ feedback.

As my interest in Machine Learning grew so did my radar for it. I started to notice processes in devices that were automated, some more subtle than others. What I noticed more than anything, though, was data, specifically our, and by our I mean _users_ submission and acquisition of data. Once you know a little bit about the mechanics of Machine Learning, data takes on a new significance because you know what data affords. Data allows someone to predict, sometimes with astonishing accuracy, the future.

My first Coop was with a Sawmill Optimization company that sought to predict defects in lumber using images of that lumber. My years of Quality Control and my familiarity with lumber finally started to pay off. My experience in the sawmilling field led to me leading a group of Coop students in a labelling task. Our job was to find defect in images of lumber and label them. Today, if I find myself in a building made of any type of timber, some muscle memory kicks in.

Some days sucked. Lots of days sucked. We were Computer Science students taht were being used like robots. Day in and day out we'd circle defects, handle lumber, map what we saw in reality to a polygon on a screen. It was far from meaningful work.

But meaning is what you make it.
