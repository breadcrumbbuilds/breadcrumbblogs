title: All Univseral Statements Are False

I'll keep this short. People speak in absolutes. When they do, they're wrong. Abosulte statements carry this hidden assumption that the speaker has all the data. They don't, so they're wrong. In the interest of remaining consisten, it is _likely_ they're wrong.
