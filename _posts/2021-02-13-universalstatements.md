title: All Univseral Statements Are False

I'll keep this short. People speak in absolutes. Abosulte statements carry this hidden assumption that the speaker has all the data. They don't, so they're wrong. In the interest of remaining consistent, we should say it's _likely_ they're wrong.

Words like `likely` and `probably` qualify absolute statements, increasing the _likelihood_ of the statement's accuracy. If you wish to speak or convey thoughts and opinions in an intelligent manner, consider qualifying the statement. Taking a step further, quantify your qualification, though avoid arbitrary quantification. These are simple strategies to avoid being considered an imbecile, though with any strategy, there are weaknesses. There is a threshold of qualification that once surpassed, sees the speaker sail the seas of categorically true and beach on the Plains of Pedantistan.
