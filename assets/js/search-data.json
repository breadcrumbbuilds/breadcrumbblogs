            "content": "There seems to be a correlation between happiness and autonomy. Folks enjoying high autonomy seem to spend their time enthralled by things they love, which explains some of the success of my favourite content creators. Lex Fridman is a great podcast host precisely because he asks the questions he wants to ask. He exercises his autonomy when choosing the direction of a conversation. He exercises his autonomy by speaking to guests he chooses and by wearing the same damn black suit every episode. . Substitute autonomy with authenticity and the paragraph stands. . I think autonomy enables authenticity. Authenticity has the power to generate autonomy as well. .",

            "content": "I’ll keep this short. People speak in absolutes. Absolute statements carry this hidden assumption that the speaker has all the data. They don’t, so they’re wrong. In the interest of remaining consistent, we should say it’s likely they’re wrong. . Words like likely and probably qualify absolute statements, increasing the likelihood of the statement’s accuracy. If you wish to speak or convey thoughts and opinions intelligently, consider qualifying the statement. Taking a step further, quantify your qualification, though avoid arbitrary quantification (people sense bs, part of the reason the used car salesman is an archetype). These are simple strategies to avoid being an imbecile, though with any strategy, there are weaknesses. There exists a threshold of qualification that once surpassed sees the speaker sail the seas of categorically true and beach on the Plains of Pedantistan. .",

            "content": "Starting A Business . Starting a Startup is chock-full of feelings foreign to your average public school small-town kid. The uncertainty makes your skin crawl, the explicit acknowledgment of hierarchal structure makes even the most iron of stomachs warble, and you have to have determination in pursuit of a goal. That means you have to have the skills to formulate goals, develop a plan to achieve the goal, and then follow through on the plan all the while adjusting to new insights and changing landscapes. In a word, you need to learn to be adaptable. . Partners get disinterested, so you need some notion of cultivating interest, which means you need to have good insight into other people and what makes them tick. In a word, you need to have dexterous skills in empathy. . There’s myriad skills to acquire, but none of them mean a damn unless you start. Starting, committing to building the business, is the single largest hurdle. . How do you know where to go when there’s no road? How do you know how to lead your comrades down a dark and untravelled path? How do you forge a path if there isn’t one? These questions swirl in my mind while I should be thinking of my business. .",
